# Introduction

This book is designed for participants of the PSYNETS workshop to help them get acquainted with the basic functionalities of R and the R packages used throughout the sessions. It has been compiled based on the most frequently asked questions and challenges that participants have encountered during previous workshops. While not a comprehensive guide to R for network psychometrics, it serves as a quick reference to help you get started with R and the specific packages used in the workshop. The primary focus is on installing packages, loading data from various formats, and understanding the unique features of each packages covered in the course. Whenever you have a technical question about R, we recommend consulting this book first.
